Data for each species (golden headed lion tamarins, emperor tamarins, and Goeldi's monkeys) are separated as during or after 
slow or fast music exposure, and instances of time spent out of sight during and after slow or fast music. 
The following abbreviations are used to label the data:
E = Emperor tamarins // GHLT = Golden headed lion tamarins // G = Goeldi's monkeys 
AF = after fast // AS = after slow 
DF = during fast // DS = during slow 
AF_OOS = instances spent out of sight after fast music // AS_OOS = instances spent out of sight after slow music
DF_OOS = instances spent out of sight during fast music // DS_OOS = instances spent out of sight during slow music



R code used to analyze results is included. Although bonferroni correction was performed, original p-values are reported in the study.
